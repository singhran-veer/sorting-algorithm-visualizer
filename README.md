# 🧠 Sorting Visualizer
-Implemented core sorting algorithms and visualized element swaps using animation.

-Each sorting method (Bubble, Quick, Selection, Merge) was written from scratch, demonstrating algorithmic understanding.

-Used JavaScript and DOM manipulation to animate comparisons and swaps.


A web-based visualization tool that demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work using animated bar charts.
